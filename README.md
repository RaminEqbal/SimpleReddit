#What is Simple Reddit
Simple Reddit is a front-end web application built without any frameworks (except jQuery). The app itself has no serverside component
so everything run is based on the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you see here.

Despite being simply built, it's designed to be simply used. This is employed by the absensce of lengthy animations, and by the immediate reactions following an action. Due to this lightweight nature, Simple Reddit is comfortably used on lower-end hardware.
